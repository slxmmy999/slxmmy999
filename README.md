## Power to the People, Code for the Community :fist: 

I'm a programmer who's deeply influenced by the punk rock scene. Like punk rock, I believe in challenging the status quo, specifically corporate control and greed. I strive to contribute to the open-source community and always eager to learn new skills. 

## :headphones: My Projects
